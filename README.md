# VR Visualizer
Compatible with Google Cardboard, this application places users in an immersive VR audio visualization of music.

## Purpose
This application serves to demonstrate the use of virtual reality technology within the scope of music by creating a more involved, interactive music experience for the client.

## Contents
In this repository, I've only included the script that actually manipulates the Unity Game Objects to make the visualization happen. If you would like to clone the repository with all of the necessary Unity assets, please contact me directly.

## Going Forward
I am looking to expand this application in several ways, both large and small. I plan to support Spotify capabilities to allow the client to play music directly from his own music library. Additionally, I plan to release the application on the Android app store.
